## Description: 
This is a simple project that displays links to various social media profiles.
Project is live [here](https://deesclouds-social-links.netlify.app/)
### Installation:
To use this project, simply clone the repo and open `index.html` into your web browser.

### Usage: 
To add your own social media links, open `js/main.js` and add a new object to the `socialLinks` array.
The object should contain a `name` property (the name of the social media platform) and a `url` property (the link to your profile on that platform).

For example, to add a link for your Twitter profile, add the following object to the `socialLinks` array:

```
{
    name: 'Twitter',
    url: 'https://twitter.com/yourusername'
}
```
### Customization: 
You can customize the look and feel of the link by editing the CSS file in `css/style.css`.
